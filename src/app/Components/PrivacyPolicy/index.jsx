                      GLOBALITCON believes electronic privacy is crucial to the
                      ongoing success of the Internet, whether as a commercial
                      or an entertainment medium. Our policy is to keep the
                      personal information we receive completely confidential,
                      and use it solely for internal purposes. We will not share
                      your personal information with any other party. Please
                      revisit our Privacy Policy from time to time to be sure
                      that you are familiar with our current policy. Your
                      continued use of the GLOBALITCON website after any
                      modifications to this Privacy Policy will be viewed as
                      representing your acceptance of such changes. GLOBALITCON

                    <p>
                      GLOBALITCON’s primary goal in collecting personal
                      information is to deliver a customized and personalized
                      service to our clients. GLOBALITCON also uses the personal
                      information it collects to send clients email
                      notifications of new features or services available, and
                      other information that GLOBALITCON feels might be of
                      interest to its clients. In order to provide our clients
                      with a more personalized, relevant and intelligent
                      service, GLOBALITCON regularly makes improvements to the
                      GLOBALITCON website. The collection of personal data
                      greatly assists GLOBALITCON in this improvement process by
                      identifying the specific interests and needs of the many
                      clients of GLOBALITCON.

                      Because we collect information on our website for various

                      what we do with it in the following sections:

                      Our site contains registration and/or request forms that
                      require users to give us contact information (such as
                      their name and email address). We use customer contact
                      information from the registration and request forms to
                      send you information about our services and to contact you

                      Except as set forth in the Terms of Use, GLOBALITCON will

                      larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that
                      indicate the percentage of our clients/users that in a
                      specific industry), but that information will not be
                      sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.

                      (whether by merger, sale or otherwise), the personal
                      contact information we collect could be sold as part of
                      that transaction and potentially could be used by the
                      purchaser. Should a merger, sale or related business
                      transaction ever take place between GLOBALITCON and
                      another company, a notice will be posted on the

                      GLOBALITCON makes use of a technology called cookies.
                      Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by
                      your web browser software on your computer's hard drive or
                      temporarily in your computer's memory. The use of cookies
                      is now an industry standard and users will find them on
                      most major websites. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be
                      used to find out the identity of any user. GLOBALITCON
                      will only store information that adds to your browsing
                      experience. This information is not personally
                      identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take
                      advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most
                      Web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose
                      which cookies to accept. Check your browser's
